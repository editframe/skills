# Emotional Arcs for Video

Proven narrative structures that guide viewer emotions through video content.

## Why Emotional Arcs Matter

Every effective video takes the viewer on an emotional journey. The arc determines:
- **Engagement**: Whether viewer keeps watching
- **Memory**: Whether message sticks
- **Action**: Whether viewer responds to CTA

Without an intentional arc, videos feel flat or confusing.

## The Three-Act Structure

### Act 1: Setup (First 25%)
**Purpose**: Establish context, hook attention  
**Emotion**: Curiosity, recognition, or tension  
**What happens**: Introduce problem, character, or question

### Act 2: Development (Middle 50%)
**Purpose**: Build understanding, create investment  
**Emotion**: Interest, concern, hope, or excitement  
**What happens**: Explore problem, show solution, build case

### Act 3: Resolution (Final 25%)
**Purpose**: Deliver payoff, inspire action  
**Emotion**: Satisfaction, inspiration, or urgency  
**What happens**: Resolve tension, show outcome, call to action

## Core Emotional Arc Patterns

### 1. The Problem-Solution Arc

**Emotional Journey**: Frustration → Hope → Relief

**Structure**:
- **Start**: Frustrated with current situation
- **Middle**: Hopeful about solution

**Best for**: Storytelling, complex ideas, emotional content

## Emotional Intensity

### Building Intensity
Start lower, build to peak, resolve higher than start.

```
Emotion
   ^
   |           /\
   |          /  \___
   |    _____/
   |___/
   +----------------> Time
```

**Best for**: Most videos - natural arc

### Sustained High Intensity
Start high, maintain, end high.

```
Emotion
   ^
   |  _______________
   | /               \
   |/                 \
   |
   +----------------> Time
```

**Best for**: Urgent messages, high-energy brands, short videos

### Roller Coaster
Multiple peaks and valleys.

```
Emotion
   ^
   |  /\    /\    /\
   | /  \  /  \  /  \
   |/    \/    \/    \
   |
   +----------------> Time
```

**Best for**: Longer videos, complex stories, entertainment

## Testing Your Emotional Arc

Ask these questions:

1. **Clear starting emotion?** Viewer should feel something specific at start
2. **Intentional progression?** Emotion should change deliberately
3. **Satisfying resolution?** Viewer should feel payoff
4. **Matches brand?** Arc should align with brand personality
5. **Serves objective?** Arc should support video goal

## Common Mistakes

### Starting Too High
If you start at peak emotion, nowhere to go. Start lower to allow build.

### No Progression
If emotion is flat throughout, video feels boring. Must have change.

### Unearned Resolution
If you don't build properly, resolution feels hollow. Journey matters.

### Wrong Arc for Objective
Aspiration arc won't drive urgent conversion. Match arc to goal.

### Ignoring Brand Personality
Surprise arc for conservative brand feels off. Stay true to brand.

### Too Many Peaks
Multiple emotional peaks in short video exhausts viewer. One clear arc.

## Arc + Visual Style

The emotional arc should be reinforced by visual choices:

### Problem-Solution Arc
- **Problem**: Darker, desaturated, confined spaces
- **Solution**: Brighter, saturated, open spaces

### Transformation Arc
- **Before**: Muted colors, static shots
- **After**: Vibrant colors, dynamic movement

### Discovery Arc
- **Start**: Mysterious, partial reveals
- **End**: Full reveals, bright, clear

### Aspiration Arc
- **Throughout**: Beautiful, aspirational imagery
- **Intensifying**: More impressive as video progresses

### Urgency Arc
- **Start**: Calm
- **Middle**: Increasing tension (faster cuts, tighter shots)
- **End**: Peak urgency (rapid pace, direct address)

## Arc + Music

Music should follow and enhance the emotional arc:

### Building Arc
Music should crescendo with emotion, peak at climax

### Sustained Arc
Consistent energy level, driving rhythm

### Transformation Arc
Music should shift character from before to after

### Discovery Arc
Music should build wonder and excitement

### Reassurance Arc
Music should move from tense to calm
