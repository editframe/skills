# Motion Design

Professional motion graphics cognitive skills for creating purposeful, polished animations.

## Core Principle

**Motion should always serve communication, not decoration.** Every animation must have clear intent and guide viewer attention.

## The 20 Motion Design Skills

### Foundation Skills (Start Here)
1. [Message & Intent Analysis](references/message-intent-analysis.md) - Translate goals into motion strategy
2. [Attention Choreography](references/attention-choreography.md) - Plan sequential viewer focus flow
3. [Timing Intelligence](references/timing-intelligence.md) - Determine duration based on multiple factors

### Core Motion Techniques
4. [Easing Mastery](references/easing-mastery.md) - Select acceleration/deceleration curves
5. [Physics Simulation](references/physics-simulation.md) - Apply realistic or stylized physics
8. [Stagger & Sequencing](references/stagger-sequencing.md) - Create rhythmic patterns across elements

### Advanced Animation
6. [Squash & Stretch](references/squash-stretch.md) - Add life through strategic deformation
7. [Anticipation & Follow-Through](references/anticipation-follow-through.md) - Preparation and continuation
9. [Arc & Path Construction](references/arc-path-construction.md) - Define natural motion trajectories
14. [Exaggeration Calibration](references/exaggeration-calibration.md) - Push beyond realism appropriately

### UI Animation Patterns
10. [Entrance & Exit Patterns](references/entrance-exit-patterns.md) - Appear/disappear transitions
16. [State Transitions](references/state-transitions.md) - Hover, focus, loading, success, error states

### Specialized Techniques
17. [Text Animation](references/text-animation.md) - Typography-specific principles
18. [Color Transitions](references/color-transitions.md) - Smooth color changes over time
19. [Particles & Effects](references/particles-effects.md) - Ambient and celebratory particle systems

### Composition & Polish
11. [Staging & Composition](references/staging-composition.md) - Visual hierarchy and clarity during motion
12. [Rhythm & Pacing](references/rhythm-pacing.md) - Musical timing structure and beats
13. [Material & Weight](references/material-weight.md) - Express physical properties through timing
15. [Looping](references/looping.md) - Seamless infinite animations

### Process
20. [Iteration & Refinement](references/iteration-process.md) - Systematic workflow from concept to polish

## Quick Reference

### Base Durations
- **Mobile UI**: 200-300ms
- **Desktop UI**: 300-500ms  
- **Cinematic**: 800-1200ms
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-250ms

### Common Timings
- Hover enter: 150-200ms
- Hover exit: 200-300ms
- Focus: 200-300ms
- Success: 600-1000ms
- Error: 400-600ms
- Loading loops: 1200-1500ms

### Easing Rules
- **Entrances**: ease-out (decelerating)
- **Exits**: ease-in (accelerating)
- **Within-screen**: ease-in-out (smooth)
- **Never**: linear (except mechanical)

### Stagger Delays
- Per character: 30-50ms
- Per word: 80-120ms
- Per line: 200-300ms
- List items: 50ms
- Card groups: 150ms
- Major sections: 400ms+

### One Focus at a Time
**Never** have multiple unrelated elements moving simultaneously. Motion competes for attention—sequence everything.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Message First** - What should the viewer remember/feel/do?
2. **Guide Attention** - One focus point at any moment
3. **Respect Physics** - Motion must feel plausible (unless stylized)
4. **Add Polish Last** - Get timing right before adding secondary motion
5. **Iterate Systematically** - Broad strokes → easing → secondary → polish
