## Extracting Brand Colors

When analyzing a website:

1. **Primary color**: Most prominent color, usually in logo and CTAs
2. **Secondary colors**: Supporting colors in headers, sections, accents
3. **Accent colors**: Highlights, hover states, special elements
4. **Background colors**: Overall page background, section backgrounds
5. **Text colors**: Primary text, secondary text, links

### Color Dominance
- **>40% of visual space**: Dominant primary color
- **20-40%**: Strong secondary color
- **10-20%**: Supporting color
- **<10%**: Accent color

### Color Context
Consider where colors appear:
- **Logo**: Core brand identity color
- **CTAs**: Action/urgency color
- **Headers**: Authority/structure color
- **Backgrounds**: Mood/atmosphere color

## Applying to Video

### Opening (Hook)
Use brand's most distinctive color prominently. This creates immediate brand recognition.

### Middle (Content)
Balance brand colors with neutral space. Don't overwhelm - use colors strategically to highlight key points.

### Closing (CTA)
Use brand's CTA color (often accent color) to drive action. Should stand out clearly.

### Throughout
- **Consistency**: Use same colors for same purposes (e.g., always use accent color for CTAs)
- **Hierarchy**: Primary color for main elements, secondary for supporting, accent for highlights
- **Breathing room**: Don't fill every pixel with color - use neutrals to create space
- **Emotional arc**: Can shift color saturation/brightness to match emotional journey

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using too many colors**: Stick to 3-4 main colors maximum
2. **Ignoring contrast**: Text must be readable, elements must be distinguishable
3. **Clashing colors**: Use color wheel relationships (complementary, analogous, triadic)
4. **Forgetting accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG guidelines)
5. **Inconsistent usage**: Same color should mean same thing throughout video
6. **Overwhelming saturation**: Highly saturated colors throughout can cause eye strain
