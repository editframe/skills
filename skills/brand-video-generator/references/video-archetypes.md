## Testing Your Archetype Choice

Ask these questions:
1. **Does it match industry expectations?** (meet or intentionally break)
2. **Does it serve the objective?** (awareness vs conversion need different approaches)
3. **Does it fit the platform?** (TikTok vs LinkedIn are very different)
4. **Does it match brand personality?** (playful vs serious)
5. **Is the length appropriate?** (enough time to communicate, not too long)

## Breaking the Mold

Sometimes the best video breaks industry conventions. Do this when:
- **Brand is disruptor**: Show it in video style
- **Industry is stale**: Stand out with different approach
- **Audience is fatigued**: Give them something fresh
- **Message demands it**: Some stories need unique telling

But break conventions **intentionally**, not accidentally.
