# Transition Styles

Types of transitions, their emotional impact, and when to use them in video.

## Why Transitions Matter

Transitions are not just technical necessities - they:
- **Guide attention**: Direct viewer's eye to what's next
- **Set pacing**: Control the rhythm and energy
- **Create meaning**: Suggest relationships between scenes
- **Express brand**: Reflect personality and style

The wrong transition can break immersion; the right one enhances the story.

## Transition Patterns

**Best for**: Videos with building emotional arc  
**Risk**: Can peak too early

### Signature Transition
One unique transition used at key moments.

**Effect**: Memorable, branded, impactful  
**Best for**: Brand recognition, recurring content series  
**Risk**: Can feel gimmicky if wrong transition

## Transition + Scene Relationship

### Continuous Action

**Why**: Maintains flow of action

### Related Concepts
**Best transition**: Cross-fade or simple slide  
**Why**: Shows connection

### Contrasting Concepts
**Best transition**: Fade to black/white or push  
**Why**: Emphasizes difference

### Time Passage
**Best transition**: Fade to black or dissolve  
**Why**: Signals temporal shift

### Spatial Movement
**Best transition**: Slide or zoom  
**Why**: Shows spatial relationship

### Transformation
**Best transition**: Morph or cross-fade  
**Why**: Shows change process

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Transitioning
Using complex transitions when simple cut would work.  
**Fix**: Default to cuts or simple fades, use complex transitions sparingly

### Inconsistent Style
Mixing many different transition types randomly.  
**Fix**: Choose 2-3 transition types and stick to them

### Wrong Duration
Transitions too slow for fast content or too fast for emotional content.  
**Fix**: Match duration to overall pacing

### Meaningless Direction
Slide direction doesn't match meaning (e.g., sliding left for "next").  
**Fix**: Make direction intentional and consistent

### Gimmicky Transitions
Using flashy transitions that don't match brand.  
**Fix**: Choose transitions that reinforce brand personality

### Ignoring Accessibility
Rapid flashing or extreme motion in transitions.  
**Fix**: Test for motion sensitivity, provide warnings if needed

## Platform Considerations

- **Why**: Fast-paced platform, short attention span
- **Avoid**: Slow fades, complex transitions

- **Avoid**: Overuse of flashy transitions

- **Why**: Professional context
- **Avoid**: Playful wipes, glitches, anything too casual

### Website
- **Prefer**: Matches brand - can be more sophisticated
- **Why**: Engaged audience, brand context
- **Avoid**: Nothing specific, just match brand

### Paid Ads

- **Why**: Every second costs money
- **Avoid**: Slow transitions that waste ad spend

## Testing Transitions

Ask these questions:

1. **Does it match brand personality?**
2. **Does it match pacing?**
3. **Does it serve the story?**
4. **Is it consistent with other transitions?**
5. **Does it feel invisible or intentional?** (both can be right)
6. **Does it respect viewer attention?**

## Implementation in Editframe

Most transitions can be achieved with CSS animations and the `overlap` attribute on `ef-timegroup`:

```html
<!-- Cross-fade with 1s overlap -->
<ef-timegroup mode="sequence" overlap="1s">
  <ef-timegroup duration="5s" class="fade-in-out">Scene 1</ef-timegroup>
  <ef-timegroup duration="5s" class="fade-in-out">Scene 2</ef-timegroup>
</ef-timegroup>

<!-- Slide transition -->
<ef-timegroup mode="sequence">
  <ef-timegroup duration="5s" class="slide-out-left">Scene 1</ef-timegroup>
  <ef-timegroup duration="5s" class="slide-in-right">Scene 2</ef-timegroup>
</ef-timegroup>
```

Reference the `elements-composition` skill for specific implementation patterns.
